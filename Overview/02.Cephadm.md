# Cephadm

Cephadm is a new feature in the Octopus release and has seen limited use in production and at scale. We would like users to try cephadm, especially for new clusters, but please be aware that some functionality is still rough around the edges. We expect fairly frequent updates and improvements over the first several bug fix releases of Octopus.
